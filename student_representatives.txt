===================================
Student Representatives Details
===================================
- Elected by student members
- 2-year term, one new representative elected each year
- Student representatives have the same status and voting privileges as Councilors. Any graduate student member may self-nominate to serve as a representative, and the student representatives will be selected through the following process. First, current student representatives will solicit nominations and will assemble a ballot list. This list will then be distributed to the student members of the society for voting. The timing of this vote will coincide with the annual election process for other officers. Each representative will serve a two-year term, and one new representative is elected each year, allowing their terms to be staggered. [excerpt from SSB Constitution]

Student rep todos
=================================

A. Getting on the SSB council listserv
Email the current communications director. Ask that new reps be added and retiring reps be removed from the list.

B. Evolution travel reimbursement instructions
You will need to pay for this upfront because the Society does reimbursement only.  You will collect the receipts (your plane ticket and the one night receipt).  If you are driving, you will be reimbursed by mileage according to the current year’s rate per mile as determined by the IRS. 
Email the current program director with the total amount and your home address (the one that is on your W-2). This information will put it into a to-be-made google doc that keeps track of reimbursements. 
Accountant Rob Clayton is in charge of issuing payment to you and the treasurer should be cc’d with this information.

Call for SSB Student Council Members

     The Society of Systematic Biologists Council is inviting nominations for one new graduate student representative. As a member of the SSB Council, you will have the opportunity to participate in the workings of a society and interact with many of the great researchers in the society. Student council members will aid the society in developing initiatives to better serve our student members, participate in council meetings to provide input, and engage with student representatives from other societies (e.g. the American Society of Naturalists and the Society for the Study of Evolution) to support joint activities, such as student-oriented events at the Evolution meetings.
We are electing one representative for a 2-year term beginning in December XXXX. Representatives will assist the selection of new student representatives at the end of their terms. In order to support participation in council meetings, which take place at the Evolution meetings, the SSB will cover travel costs (e.g., airfare) and one night of accommodation for student representatives. Student representatives are expected to be active members of SSB (student membership is $25), to attend the annual Evolution meetings, and to serve on the council for their full term (extension into postdoctoral work is fine). If you would like to join us, please email XXXXXX (email) by XXXX with the subject “SSB Student Rep” and attach a single PDF document (SSBStudentRep_LastName.pdf) containing your CV and a short paragraph (less than 1 page) about what you hope to contribute or why you want to be a part of the council. You can visit our website, www.systbio.org, to learn more about the society and its activities.
